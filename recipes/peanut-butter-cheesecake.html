         </ul>

         <h4>For The Chocolate Topping</h4>

             <li>1/2 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
             <li>1/3 c. heavy whipping cream</li>
             <li>Cocktail peanuts, chopped peanut butter cups and flaked salt, to garnish(optional)</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Directions:</h3>
         <ol>
             <li>For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Tightly wrap the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan with foil.</li>
             <li>Place the peanuts in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until roughly chopped. Add the wafer cookies and light brown sugar. Pulse until very finely ground. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles wet sand.</li>
             <li>Transfer the mixture to the springform pan. Using the bottom of a glass, press the crust into the bottom and about 1-inch up the side of the pan. Place the springform pan inside of a roasting pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove and let cool while making the filling. Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F.</li>
             <li>For the filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and sour cream on medium-low speed until totally smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the peanut butter, sugar, and salt. Beat on medium-low speed until completely combined. With the mixer running, add the eggs, one at a time until each is fully incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl  in between eggs. Mix in the whipping cream until combined. Pour the batter into the crust. (The batter will almost fill the pan.) Gently tap or jiggle the pan to level the batter.</li>
             <li>Boil 8 cups of water. Place the roasting pan with the cheese cake in the oven. Very carefully pour the water into the roasting pan until about 1 inch deep.</li>
             <li>Bake for 75 to 80 minutes or until the filling is puffed and the center slightly wobbles when the pan is gently shaken. Add more hot water to the pan during baking if needed. Turn off the oven, crack the door a few inches, and let cool in the oven for 1 hour. Remove and finish cooling to room temperature. Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and remove the foil from the pan.</li>
             <li>Chill the cooled cheesecake for at least 6 hours or overnight. When ready to serve, run a thin knife or offset spatula around the sides of the cheesecake to release it from the pan. Release and remove the side of the springform pan and transfer to a serving plate. </li>
             <li>For the topping: Place the chocolate chips in a small heat-proof bowl. Microwave the cream until very hot and just starting to bubble, about 1 minute. Pour cream over the chocolate and let stand for 10 minutes. Stir until the chocolate is fully melted.</li>
             <li>Pour the ganache over the top of the chilled cheesecake and spread to the edges to let it drip down. Garnish with peanuts, salt, and peanut butter cups, if desired. Refrigerate until ready to serve. </li>
             
         </ol>
